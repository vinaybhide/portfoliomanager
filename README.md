# portfoliomanager to manage stocks using AlphaVantage
      1. Allows user to manage their stock portfolio
      2. Allows developers to leverage AlphaVantage to fetch real time global stock data
      3. Uses matplotlib to plot various graphs that user can use to research their stock holdings
      4. Leverages tkinter to show meu options, Tree View, right/left click operations, mouse hover operation
      5. Various show/hide techniques for plots
# Pre-requisites for development:
      1. I developed this on Win7 using Python 3.8.2 32-bit on Win 7
      2. Make sure you have PIP (latest version I have used is 3)
      1. Verify by executing: 
            pip --version
      2. If pip isnâ€™t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library:
            python -m ensurepip --default-pip
      3. Ensure pip is up to date
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      3. install following:
      1. pip install alpha_vantage
      2. pip install pandas
      3. pip install matplotlib
      4. pip install tkcalendar
      4. In addition I have used tkinter module for graphics, which is available as standard library
      5. Before you execute Portfolio Manager
      1 Create a sub-directory 'scriptdata' in the same folder where you copied the source code (.py files)
      2. Get developer key from Alpha Vantage website: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#support
      6. First use of Portfolio Manager
      1. Use menu 'Help->Add Key & Data Folder' and provide the Alpha Vantage key & path where you want to keep data files
      2. The folder you specify is used to store CSV files retrieved from Alpha Vantage in 'Test' mode of application
      7. General description of Portfolio Manager application using alpha vantage to manage stock portfolio & do research

# Development History
v0.5 - Bug fixes and features
   1. Bugfix-get quote was getting called for each row in Open file. Fixed by passing DataFrame from OpenFile to get_stock_quote
   2. Bugfix-in the performance graph the portfolio value is shown from last date of purchase with total holding instead of first date
   3. Bugfix-There was a pandas warning while doing cumulative sum of all the holding. Fixed that using .loc
   5. Correction - moved  Analyze Script->Show historical proce series of selected script to Mouse right click->Daily closing Vs SMA
         Added 20 day SMA graph in the same plot
   6. Added graphs on right click on selected script. Handling of movement is also taken care.
v0.6 - Added test data support via downloaded file for all except get_quote_endpoint and search_endpoint
   1. How to use Test data option (ideal for offline demos without Get Quote and Add/Modify functionality)?
      1.1 From Help->Test Mode (On/Off) you can toggle the test mode
      1.2 All the historical data including price & indicator and end point quote is cached in csv files in folder 'ScriptData'
      1.3 The free key of Alpha vantage has limitation of 5 calls per 5 minute/ total 500 calls per day
      1.4 Suggested approach is extract all data once daily.
      1.5 Note the script search in the Get Quote and add script dialog is still ONLINE
      1.6 You can select existing portfolio file to open. You have to make sure that you have the specific script end point quote file
      1.7 Once the portfolio is open all functionality should work fine
 v0.7 - Base version with all graphs and bug fixes and also code identified for mouse move & click on graphs
 v0.8 - Added OHLC Candlestick graph in backtestsma
 v0.9
      1. Added Research graph popup dialog - can be accessed via menu & left click on script graph
      2. Added on mouse move show amount for DailyVsSMA graph. Needs improvement
 v1.0 - All beta features complete
      1. Added consolidated portfolio performance screen
      2. Added Apple stock download to download feature
 v1.0.1 - Added new menu and dialog for entering alpha vantage key and selecting data file folder used in 'Test' mode
      1. All classes using Test mode now accept data file folder in their constructor
      2. TestData class and download data classes are changed to accept folder during runtime
